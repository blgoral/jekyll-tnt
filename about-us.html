<h2 id="append">
	Where Experience Meets Compassion</h2>
<p>
	Dentistry isn&rsquo;t <em>just </em>about top-notch clinical skill. For Dr. James Schumacher, what differentiates a truly great dentist is their ability to give their patients fully personalized care <em>and </em>a comfortable experience while in the chair. This has been his goal for over 30 years, and it motivates him to complete continuing education courses and stay on top of the latest breakthroughs in dentistry. To come see why so many Jacksonville residents proudly call our office their dental home, contact us today to schedule an appointment.</p>

		Dr. Schumacher seamlessly combines old-school, one-on-one service with some of the most advanced dental technology available today. Your checkups will be completed using a small, high-powered camera and low-radiation digital X-rays. If you need treatment, he can administer local anesthetic with The Wand, which allows you to skip the uncomfortable injection. And for patients with gum disease, he can take care of it non-invasively with laser gum therapy.</p>

		Jacksonville is our beloved home, which is why our team dedicates much of our free time to giving back and making it a better place to live for everyone. Dr. Schumacher supports numerous Catholic charities in the area and also teaches/mentors at the University of Florida Dental School. He and our team are also big animal lovers, so we frequently donate to and partner with our local rescue shelters as well.</p>
